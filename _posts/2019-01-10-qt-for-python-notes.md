Qt for Python is an extension of the classical Qt with C++. It works using the same class structures and syntax adapted to the Python syntax.

# Installation

First of all, the required softwares are:

1. Python version > 3.5
2. pip: This is a tool used to install new packages under the Python environment.
3. Qt (I installed version 5.9.4 and it works but Qt recommends Qt > 5.11. I do not use Qt creator as IDE, I run the scripts from terminal)

Once these softwares are installed (normally they are installed together) just run:
```
pip install PySide2
```
Now the system is ready for creating the Qt for python application it is possible to start developing.
